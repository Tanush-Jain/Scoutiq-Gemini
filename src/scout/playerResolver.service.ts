/**
 * ScoutIQ - Player Resolver Service
 * 
 * Retrieves player information from GRID Central API.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: GRID Central API has a platform limitation - there is no supported
 * way to query players by team. The API doesn't expose:
 * - team.players field
 * - players(filter: { teamId: ... })
 * - team.roster field
 * - team.activePlayers field
 * - gameTeams query
 * 
 * This is a GRID API design limitation, not a code issue.
 * 
 * The system handles this gracefully by:
 * 1. Returning empty player arrays
 * 2. Using AI-generated roster information from the LLM
 * 3. Continuing with matchup analysis without player data
